/**
 * The main unit in the state machine: a function that gets a character code
 * and has certain effects.
 * <p>
 * A state function should return another function: the next
 * state-as-a-function to go to.
 * <p>
 * But there is one case where they return void: for the eof character code
 * (at the end of a value).
 * The reason being: well, there isnâ€™t any state that makes sense, so void
 * works well.
 * Practically that has also helped: if for some reason it was a mistake, then
 * an exception is throw because there is no next function, meaning it
 * surfaces early.
