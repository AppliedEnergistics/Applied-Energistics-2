# Tips and Tricks

A load of random little recommendations

- Keep your network treelike and avoid loops
- Full-block [devices](ae2-mechanics/devices.md) in groups of 8 or less unless you deeply understand how [channels](ae2-mechanics/channels.md)
route through a network
- Pick a wood and stick with it for all your [patterns](items-blocks-machines/patterns.md). Yes, enabling substitutions
in patterns sometimes works, but using the same wood type everywhere greatly reduces hassle.
- Arrange your [patterns](items-blocks-machines/patterns.md) vertically in the <ItemLink id="pattern_access_terminal" />/
distribute your patterns between your [providers](items-blocks-machines/pattern_provider.md) so that recipes can be performed in parallel.
- Add an [energy cell](items-blocks-machines/energy_cells.md) so that your network can handle power spikes.
- You can use water in the <ItemLink id="condenser" />
- The best way to keep your network clean is to not put random mob loot like swords and armor in. Each unique combination of
enchantment and durability is another [type](ae2-mechanics/bytes-and-types.md).
