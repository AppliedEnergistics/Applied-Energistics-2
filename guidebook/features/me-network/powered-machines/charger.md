The <ItemLink id="charger"/> provides a way to charge
supported tools through the [ME Network](../../me-network.md) or manually using a crank.

Power can be provided via the top or bottom, via either <ItemLink
id="fluix_glass_cable"/> or other Cables, or
other mod power cables. Items can be inserted or removed from any side.

Can also be used to create <ItemLink id="charged_certus_quartz_crystal"/>
from <ItemLink id="certus_quartz_crystal"/>, and <ItemLink id="meteorite_compass" /> from <ItemLink id="minecraft:compass" />.

To power it manually, place a crank on the top or bottom and right-click it until the item is charged.
