  title: Crystal Growth Accelerator
---

Used to accelerate [crystal growth](../../crystals.md), which allows you to create <ItemLink
id="certus_quartz_crystal"/> and

<ItemLink id="fluix_crystal" /> from crystal dust.

Must be powered by an ME Network via the top or bottom, and consumes a steady
8 ae/t while plugged in. Crystal Seeds must be in an adjacent water block to
be effected, the seeds will shimmer more rapidly when in the presence of a
powered <ItemLink id="quartz_growth_accelerator"/>.

Can only connect to cables, or other networked machines on the top and bottom
of the machine.
