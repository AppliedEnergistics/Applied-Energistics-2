![A picture of an Import Bus.](../../../assets/large/import_bus.png)Pulls items from
the inventory it is pointed at and places them into the [ME Network](../../me-network.md)'s Networked Storage.
You can specify which items it will pull out via the UI, else it tries to pull out any item in the adjacent
inventory. The <ItemLink id="import_bus"/> will
attempt to import any possible options, even if 1 or more of the configured
items cannot be stored. The <ItemLink
id="import_bus"/> requires a
[channel](../channels.md) to function.

This is the functional opposite of the <ItemLink
id="export_bus"/>.

<RecipeFor id="import_bus" />
