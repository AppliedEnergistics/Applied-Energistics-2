![A picture of an ME Chest](../../../assets/large/me_chest.png)The <ItemLink
id="chest"/> is the simplest way to use a
Storage cell, it will give you direct access to the contents of the cell
placed inside.

<ItemLink id="chest" />

show their contents and the storage cell status on the front face.

- Red - Indicates the Storage Cell is Full.
- Orange - Indicates the Storage Cell cannot hold any more types, but it can store more items.
- Green - Indicates the cell can hold more types, or more items.
- Black - Indicates there is no channel, or power is offline.

<ItemLink id="chest" />

can be powered stand alone with external power, or as part of a [ME
Network](../../me-network.md). When on a network, the storage of the
chest will be available to any other devices in the same network using an
assigned Channel. When used without a network, the chest will not transfer
full stacks at once, capping transfers at 38 items instead.

The <ItemLink id="chest"/> consumes 1 AE/t, and
consumes a small amount based on which storage cell is installed. If powered
on its own it has a very small internal storage which only lasts a few
moments, using a <ItemLink id="energy_cell"/> or
using a battery from another mod is suggested for reliable operation.

The <ItemLink id="chest"/> has two UI's, one is
used to place the storage cell inside the device from the sides or bottom, the
other is accessed by using the top surface to access the contents.

Items can be injected into the <ItemLink
id="chest"/> like any other inventory, however
items cannot be extracted with automation except via networked functions like
the <ItemLink id="export_bus"/>.
