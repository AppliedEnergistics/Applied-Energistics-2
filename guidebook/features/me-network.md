# ME Network

The main feature of Applied Energistics 2 is the ME Network (pronounced Emm-
Eee and stands for Matter Energy), which is a set of connected blocks, and
cables grouped into a system, where storage, power and functions cooperate
between multiple components.

A Network requires power, which can be provided by various blocks, and may
require <ItemLink id="controller"/>(s) if you
require more than 8 [channels](me-network/channels.md) on a single network.
