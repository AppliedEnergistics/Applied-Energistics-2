  title: Biometric Card
---

Encodes a players identity on the card, right click another player, or shift
slick to set yourself. If you encode the same player twice, it will clear the
card. A Cleared card represents other users as the "default".

When the <ItemLink id="biometric_card"/> has
been encoded it will show a Identicon for the user so you can tell cards
apart, each card for the user will have the same Identicon.
