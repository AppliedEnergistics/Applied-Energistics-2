Tool which allows you to paint in world objects with <ItemLink
id="white_paint_ball"/> or any dye items; which
are less efficient then paint balls. Supports all four types of ME Cables and
other forge coloring compatible blocks such as IC2 power cables as well as all
vanilla wools, glass blocks, glass panes and hardened clay.

You can shift click in the air, or hold shift and scroll the mouse wheel to
change the selected color of the applicator.

Functions like a storage cell which can hold <ItemLink
id="white_paint_ball"/> of all colors, so i can
be loaded with an <ItemLink id="chest"/>. And
like other tools requires power and can be charged in the <ItemLink
id="charger"/>.

In addition to coloring with paint balls it can be used to remove colors from
cables, and clean paint balls off of walls when you use snow balls inside it.

Also functions in the dispenser as a means to color blocks that are in front
of it.
