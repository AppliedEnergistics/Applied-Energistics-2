  title: Creative ME Storage Cell
---

Creative storage cells store and provide infinite quantities of the items you
configure them to store in the <ItemLink id="cell_workbench"/>, by configuring them to
store <ItemLink id="minecraft:iron_ingot"/>, you extract infinite <ItemLink id="minecraft:iron_ingot" />,
and store infinite <ItemLink id="minecraft:iron_ingot" />

Only configured items or fluids can be stored/extracted.

These are not intended as infinite storage, but rather as a way to generate infinite items.

They can only be spawned in **Creative Mode**.
