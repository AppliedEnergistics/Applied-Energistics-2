  title: ME Level Emitter
---

![An active Level Emitter](../../../assets/large/emitter2.png)The <ItemLink
id="level_emitter"/> can indicate either the
level of a specified item or the [ME Network](../../me-network.md) energy
level. You can set the threshold and if the <ItemLink
id="level_emitter"/> will emit a redstone signal
or turn it off.

Requires a [channel](../channels.md) to function, if its power or
channel is lost the emitter will switch to an off state.

These can tap into the crafting system when a crafting card is installed,
allowing you to output redstone while an item is being crafted, or even
configure the system to output redstone to preform a crafting task, its
important to note that you cannot mix level emitter craft via redstone with
interface patterns.
