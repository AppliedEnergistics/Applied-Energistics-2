Facades are crafted with any facadeable block in the middle of the crafting table, and
4 <ItemLink id="cable_anchor" /> around it. They can be mounted on any variant of cables, and
around buses. They can be used to create a solid surface for things like levers or buttons,
but are for decorative in nature.
