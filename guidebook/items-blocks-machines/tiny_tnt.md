# Tiny TNT

![tiny TNT](../assets/blocks/tiny_tnt.png)

Small TNT for small explosions. Useful for making <ItemLink id="quantum_entangled_singularity"/> pairs.

It can have its block damage disabled in the config to allow making singularities without the possibility
of griefing, if you want to disable TNT and creepers on your server.
