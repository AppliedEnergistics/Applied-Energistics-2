# The Cell Workbench

<BlockImage id="cell_workbench" scale="8" />

The Cell Workbench allows you to configure [storage cells](storage_cells.md) and <ItemLink id="view_cell" />s.

You can add [upgrade cards](upgrade_cards.md) and configure "partitions" to filter what the cell will store.

Items and fluids can be dragged into the slots from JEI/REI even if you don't actually have any of that item.

Right-click with a fluid container (like a bucket or fluid tank) to set that fluid as a filter instead of the bucket or tank item.

## Settings

The cell workbench has a few buttons on the top-left:

*   You can partition a cell based on its existing contents
*   You can clear the cell's partitioning
*   The workbench can be set to retain the partition settings when the cell is removed, allowing you to copy settings between cells.
