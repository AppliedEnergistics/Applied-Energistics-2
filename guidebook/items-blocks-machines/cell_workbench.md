# The Cell Workbench

<BlockImage id="cell_workbench" scale="8" />

The Cell Workbench allows you to configure [storage cells](storage_cells.md) and <ItemLink id="view_cell" />s.

You can add upgrade cards and configure "partitions" to filter what the cell will store.

Items can be dragged into the slots from JEI/REI even if you don't actually have any of that item.

# Settings

The cell workbench has a few buttons on the top-left:

- You can partition a cell based on its existing contents
- You can clear the cell's partitioning
- The workbench can be set to retain the partition settings when the cell is removed, allowing you to copy settings between cells.
