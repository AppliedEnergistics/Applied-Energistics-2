# The Cable Anchor

<GameScene zoom="6" background="transparent">

  <IsometricCamera yaw="195" pitch="30" />
</GameScene>

Small decorative cable-mounted spikes that you can use to prevent cables from connecting, create ladders with cables, or make the cable appear
connected to the walls around it. Also used to craft <ItemLink id="facade" />.

Cable anchors prevent connections from forming on the side they're mounted on.

You can climb them like a ladder.
