# Facades

Facades can be used to make your base appear more clean. They can cover up both sizes of cable, and be made out of many
kinds of blocks.

<GameScene zoom="6">
  <ImportStructure src="../assets/assemblies/facades_1.snbt" />
  <IsometricCamera yaw="195" pitch="30" />
</GameScene>

They can cover all sides of a cable, but will let [subparts](../ae2-mechanics/cable-subparts.md) and cable connections
protrude though.

<GameScene zoom="6">
  <ImportStructure src="../assets/assemblies/facades_2.snbt" />
  <IsometricCamera yaw="195" pitch="30" />
</GameScene>

Be clever with them to improve your base aesthetic or make blocks with different textures on each side.

<GameScene zoom="4">
  <ImportStructure src="../assets/assemblies/facades_3.snbt" />
  <IsometricCamera yaw="195" pitch="30" />
</GameScene>

## Recipe

Place the block you want the texture of in the middle of 4 <ItemLink id="cable_anchor" />s.
