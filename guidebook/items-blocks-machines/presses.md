# Presses

There are 5 different presses used in the <ItemLink id="inscriber" />. 

# Processor Presses

The Silicon, Logic, Calculation, and Engineering presses are used in the production of [processors](processors.md).
These 4 presses are obtained by breaking a <ItemLink id="mysterious_cube" /> in a [meteorite](./features/meteorites.md).
They can also be duplicated in an <ItemLink id="inscriber" />.

# Name Press

The Name Press can be used in an inscriber to name items, similar to an anvil.

To craft right click the <ItemLink id="certus_quartz_cutting_knife"/> or <ItemLink id="nether_quartz_cutting_knife"/>
and insert an <ItemLink id="minecraft:iron_ingot" />, you will then have to type the name you
wish to write onto the plate then simply extract the finished plate. You can use one or two plates at a time in the inscriber,
if you use two plates, it will print the name using the combination of both names, top slot, then bottom slot.
