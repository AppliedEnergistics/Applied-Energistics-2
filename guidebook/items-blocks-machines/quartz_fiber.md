# The Quartz Fiber

<GameScene zoom="8" background="transparent">
<ImportStructure src="../assets/assemblies/quartz_fiber.snbt" />
<IsometricCamera yaw="195" pitch="30" />
</GameScene>

The quartz fiber is used to share power between [networks](../ae2-mechanics/me-network-connections.md), while keeping them separate. This allows you to power
[subnetworks](../ae2-mechanics/subnetworks.md)
without needing to put energy acceptors and power cables everywhere. It can also be used to keep cables from connecting,
although using cables of differing colors, or using <ItemLink id="cable_anchor" /> is cheaper and more effective.

They are [cable subparts](../ae2-mechanics/cable-subparts.md).
