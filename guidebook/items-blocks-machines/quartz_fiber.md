# The Quartz Fiber

![A picture of a quartz fiber separating some smart cables](../assets/assemblies/quartz_fiber.png)

The quartz fiber is used to share power between networks, while keeping them separate. This allows you to power
[subnetworks](../ae2-mechanics/subnetworks.md)
without needing to put energy acceptors and power cables everywhere. It can also be used to keep cables from connecting,
although using cables of differing colors, or using <ItemLink id="cable_anchor" /> is cheaper and more effective.
