Wrenches are used to rotate ae2 devices (right-click), and disassemble ae2 blocks (shift-right-click).
[Subparts](../ae2-mechanics/cable-subparts.md) can be removed from a cable without breaking everything on the cable
(or the cable can be removed without breaking the subparts.)

Many ae2 blocks can be rotated, so just because this guide doesn't say you can rotate something doesn't mean you can't.
