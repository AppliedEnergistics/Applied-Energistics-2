# Singularity

<ItemImage id="singularity" scale="4" />

A very compact ball of matter.

Made with 256,000 items or buckets in a <ItemLink id="condenser" /> in singularity mode.

## Quantum Entangled Singularity

<ItemImage id="quantum_entangled_singularity" scale="4" />

Required to create a connection between two [Quantum Network Bridges](quantum_bridge.md), they are always produced in matching
pairs. To create a connection place 1 of the pair of quantum entangled singularities into the <ItemLink id="quantum_link" /> of
the bridge on each side.

They are crafted by causing a reaction between <ItemLink id="minecraft:ender_pearl" /> or <ItemLink id="ender_dust" />\
and a <ItemLink id="singularity" />. Any explosive force should be enough to trigger the reaction.

<RecipeFor id="quantum_entangled_singularity" />

***Nearly any explosion - even creepers - will work.***

Always produced in pairs, but only require a single <ItemLink id="singularity" />.

It might be a good idea to label these with names when you create them using the vanilla anvil.
