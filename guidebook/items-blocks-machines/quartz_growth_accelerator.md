# The Crystal Growth Accelerator

<BlockImage id="quartz_growth_accelerator" p:powered="true" scale="8" perspective="up" />

The Crystal Growth Accelerator massively accelerates [the growth of](../ae2-mechanics/farming-certus.md) certus or amethyst when placed adjacent to the budding block.

To power it manually, place a <ItemLink id="crank"/> on the top or bottom and right-click it.

It also acts as the workstation for the AE2 villager.

It only connects to cables on its ends where the pink fluix greebles are.
