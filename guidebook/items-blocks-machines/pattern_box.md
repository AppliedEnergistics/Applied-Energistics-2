# Pattern Box

<ItemImage id="pattern_box" scale="4" />

The Pattern Box is somewhat like the [Network Tool](network_tool.md), allowing you to store and transport [Encoded Patterns](patterns.md) instead of [Upgrade Cards](upgrade_cards.md).

It has 27 slots in which to store, well, [Encoded Patterns](patterns.md), and they will be available in any AE2 device UI if the tool
is anywhere in your inventory.
