## The Inscriber

![A picture of an inscriber.](../assets/blocks/inscriber.png)

The inscriber is used to inscribe circuits and processors using presses, and to crush various items into dust. It is sided, so
inserting items from different sides inserts them into different slots in its inventory. To facilitate this, it can be
rotated with a <ItemLink id="certus_quartz_wrench" />.

The 4 circuit presses are used to craft processors

  <ItemIcon id="silicon_press" />
  <ItemIcon id="logic_processor_press" />
  <ItemIcon id="calculation_processor_press" />
  <ItemIcon id="engineering_processor_press" />
  </ItemGrid>
While the name press can be used to name blocks similar to an anvil, useful for labeling things in a <ItemLink id="pattern_access_terminal" />.

  <ItemIcon id="name_press" />
