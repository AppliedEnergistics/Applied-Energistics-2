# View Cell

<ItemImage id="view_cell" scale="2" />

View Cells are used to filter the display of [terminals](terminals.md). You partition them in a <ItemLink id="cell_workbench" />.

For example, say you want a terminal to only display a selection of stone building materials. Partition the view cell to those
materials and place it in a terminal, and only those items will be shown.
