# Budding Certus Quartz
(also see [Farming Certus](../ae2-mechanics/farming-certus.md))

![The budding certus blocks](../assets/assemblies/budding_blocks.png)

Certus quartz buds will sprout from budding certus blocks, similar to amethyst. These are found in [meteorites](../ae2-mechanics/meteorites.md)
There are 4 tiers of budding certus blocks: Flawless, Flawed, Chipped, and Damaged. They can be most easily identified
with a mod like HWYLA, Jade, The One Probe, etc. (or the f3 screen)

With flawed, chipped, and damaged budding certus, every time a bud grows by another stage, the budding block has a chance
to degrade by one tier, eventually turning into a plain <ItemLink id="quartz_block" />.

Flawless budding certus will not degrade from growing buds, and act as an infinite source.

If broken with a regular pickaxe, budding certus blocks will become certus quartz blocks. If broken with a pickaxe
enchanted with silk touch, they will instead degrade by 1 tier. **This means that flawless budding certus blocks cannot
be picked up and moved with a pickaxe**. Instead, [Spatial Storage](../ae2-mechanics/spatial-storage.md) can be used to
cut-and-paste the flawless budding blocks around.

# Recipe

Flawed, chipped, and damaged budding certus can be crafted by throwing the previous tier of budding block (or a <ItemLink id="quartz_block" />)
in water with one or more <ItemLink id="charged_certus_quartz_crystal" />.

Flawless budding certus cannot be crafted, only found in the world.
