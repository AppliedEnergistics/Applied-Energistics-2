# The Spatial IO Port

<BlockImage id="spatial_io_port" p:powered="true" scale="8" />

The Spatial IO Port is used in [spatial IO](../ae2-mechanics/spatial-io.md) to hold the [spatial cell](spatial_cells.md)
and control the spatial IO operation.

The cell can be inserted and extracted by any item logistics like hoppers or ae2 busses, if you want to automate it.
