# The Spatial Pylon

<BlockImage id="spatial_pylon" p:powered_on="true" scale="8" />

The Spatial Pylon is used in [spatial IO](../ae2-mechanics/spatial-io.md) to generate the spatial field and define the volume
to be affected.

Each continuous line of pylons uses 1 [channel](../ae2-mechanics/channels.md)

Lines of pylons must be at least 2 blocks long to function.
