# Automation of Ore Fortuning

<GameScene zoom="6">
  <ImportStructure src="../assets/assemblies/ore_fortuner.snbt" />
</GameScene>

The <ItemLink id="annihilation_plane" /> can be enchanted with any pickaxe enchantment, including fortune, so an obvious use case is to
apply fortune to a few, and have <ItemLink id="formation_plane" />s and <ItemLink id="annihilation_plane" />s rapidly place and
break ores.

Note that since <ItemLink id="import_bus" />ses "spin up to speed", the setup will start slow then reach full speed in a few seconds.

# Configurations

- The <ItemLink id="import_bus" /> (1) has a few <ItemLink id="speed_card" />s in it. More are required the more formation planes
are in the array, as they make the import bus pull more items at once.
- The <ItemLink id="formation_plane" />s (2) are in their default configurations
- The <ItemLink id="annihilation_plane" />s (3) have no GUI and cannot be configured, but are enchanted with fortune.
- The <ItemLink id="storage_bus" /> (4) is in its default configuration

# How It Works

1. The <ItemLink id="import_bus" /> on the green subnet imports blocks from the first barrel into [network storage](../ae2-mechanics/import-export-storage.md)
2. The only storage on the green subnet is the <ItemLink id="formation_plane" />, which places the blocks.
3. The <ItemLink id="annihilation_plane" /> on the orange subnet breaks the blocks, applying fortune to them.
4. The <ItemLink id="storage_bus" /> on the orange subnet stores the results of the breaking in the second barrel.
