## Item/Fluid "Pipe" Subnet
A simple method of emulating an item and/or fluid pipe with AE2 devices, useful for, well, anything you'd use an item or fluid pipe for.
This includes returning the result foa  craft to a <ItemLink id="pattern_provider"/>.

There are generally two different methods of achieving this:
### Import Bus -> Storage Bus

![The import-storage option](../assets/assemblies/import-storage-pipe.png)

The <ItemLink id="import_bus"/> on the source inventory imports the items or fluid, and attempts to store them in [network storage](../ae2-mechanics/import-export-storage.md).
Since the only storage on the network is the <ItemLink id="storage_bus"/> (which is why this is a subnet and not on your main network), the items or fluid
are placed in the destination inventory, thus being transferred. Energy is provided through a <ItemLink id="quartz_fiber"/>.
Both the import bus and storage bus can be filtered, but the setup will transfer everything it can access if no filters are applied.
This setup also works with multiple import busses and multiple storage busses.

### Storage Bus -> Export Bus

![The storage-export option](../assets/assemblies/storage-export-pipe.png)

The <ItemLink id="export_bus"/> on the destination inventory attempts to pull items in its filter from [network storage](../ae2-mechanics/import-export-storage.md).
Since the only storage on the network is the <ItemLink id="storage_bus"/> (which is why this is a subnet and not on your main network), the items or fluid
are pulled from the source inventory, thus being transferred. Energy is provided through a <ItemLink id="quartz_fiber"/>.
Because export busses must be filtered to function, this setup only operates if you filter the export bus.
This setup also works with multiple storage busses and multiple export busses.

### A Setup That Does Not Work (Import Bus -> Export Bus)

![This Does Not Work](../assets/assemblies/import-export-pipe.png)

A setup with just an import and export bus will not work. The import bus will attempt to pull from the source inventory
and store the items or fluid in network storage. The export bus will attempt to pull from network storage and put the
items or fluid in the destination inventory. However since this network **has no storage**, the import bus can't import
and the export bus can't export, so nothing happens.
