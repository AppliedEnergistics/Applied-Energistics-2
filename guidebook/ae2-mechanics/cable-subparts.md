# Cable Subparts

![Some Subparts](../assets/assemblies/subparts_demonstration.png)

In AE2, certain devices and components can be placed on cables in the same block. This is useful for compact setups.
Shift-right-clicking with a <ItemLink id="certus_quartz_wrench"/> or <ItemLink id="network_tool"/> can break a single
subpart (or the cable) off without breaking everything in that block.
