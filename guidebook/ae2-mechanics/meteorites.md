# Meteorites

<GameScene zoom="4">

Meteorites are the starting point for using AE2. They provide critical materials: [budding certus blocks](../items-blocks-machines/budding_certus.md)
of various types and a <ItemLink id="mysterious_cube" /> in the center.

[Getting Started](../getting-started.md) will provide info on what to do once you find one.

## Finding Meteorites

Meteorites are fairly common and leave massive holes in the ground, so you may have already found a few. if not, a
<ItemLink id="meteorite_compass" /> will point toward the nearest mysterious cube.
