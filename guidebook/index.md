# What is Applied Energistics 2?

Applied Energistics 2 adds components and mechanics to provide logistics and storage solutions. You can replace your
massive room full of chests with a compact ME Network, but that's just the beginning of things.
Applied Energistics is meant to work with and allow automation of other mods in a modpack. You can set up your system to,
with a single click, craft all of the prerequisites (and the final result) of a complex crafting chain, or keep certain
quantities of items in stock, crafting more as needed, or simply transfer items around your base.
