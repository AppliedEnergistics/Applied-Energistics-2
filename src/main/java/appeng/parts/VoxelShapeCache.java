 * shapes with {@link VoxelShapes#or(VoxelShape, VoxelShape)} or any other combination method, as well as
 * {@link VoxelShape#simplify()} are <b>extremely slow</b>. For example: Creating a VoxelShape for a list of 5 bounding
 * boxes 10,000 times takes about 1.7 seconds.
 *
 * <p>
 * To reduce the impact of this on cables, we introduce a global voxel shape cache so that cables can share their
