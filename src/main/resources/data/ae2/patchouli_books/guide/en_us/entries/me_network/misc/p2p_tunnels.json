      "text": "P2P Tunnel or \"Point to Point Tunnels\" are a versatile configurable system to move items / redstone / power / and fluids from one location to another though an existing ME Network without storage.$(br2)Tunnels are 1 input to N outputs. This means you can output to as many points as you want, but only input at a single point per tunnel.$(br2)Networks can support any number of tunnels, of any different types, and they all function independently.$(br2)ME Tunnels can be used to carry channels from one location to another, and can carry up to 32 channels, same as a ME Dense Cable, while only requiring a single channel per point, making tunnels a very powerful tool to expand me networks, especially over a distance. However with the great flex-ability they give you comes a limitation, the channel of a p2p tunnel cannot be carried by another p2p tunnel, meaning that you cannot nest them recursively.$(br2)To configure a P2P Tunnel you must first attune the tunnel to carry what you want it to, then you need to configure the outputs to their input. You configure the connections by using the Memory Card; First Shift+Right Click the input to save it on your memory card, then simply right click the different outputs to store the input onto the outputs. this also sets the type of the output to match the type of the input.$(br2)Tunnels can be attuned by right clicking on them with different types of items:"
