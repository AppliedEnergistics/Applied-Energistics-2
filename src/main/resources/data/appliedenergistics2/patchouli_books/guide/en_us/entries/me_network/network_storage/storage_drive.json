This block holds 10 storage cells so you can tightly pack your storage into a very small space.$(br2)ME Drives show their contents and the storage cell status on the front of the drive face.$(li)Red - Indicates the Storage Cell is Full.$(li)Orange - Indicates the Storage Cell cannot hold any more types, but it can store more items.$(li)Green - Indicates the cell can hold more types, or more items.$(li)Black - Indicates there is no channel, or power is offline.$(br2)Its important to note, that without a ME Network this block does nothing. Its only useful when combined with a way to input, and output items, and requires 2 AE/t power to function, and additional power for each Storage Cell stored inside it.$(br2)The ME Drive requires a channel to function."
