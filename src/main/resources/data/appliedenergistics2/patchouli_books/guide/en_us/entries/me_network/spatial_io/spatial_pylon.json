When powered and on a network they will either glow a light purple, or a light red, if the color is light red, that indicates design has an issue and needs to be adjusted. They emitt a small amount of light when powered.$(br2)Only useful when used in conjunction with a Spatial IO Port, All Spatial Pylon in an ME Network are part of the came SCS.$(br2)Each Spatial Pylon Multiblock requires a channel ( 1 per strand of blocks, not 1 per Spatial Pylon ) to function."
