      "text": "The ME Conversion Monitor is the upgraded version of the ME Storage Monitor. It adds the ability to directly withdraw from or store items into the ME Network. The ME Conversion Monitor can be locked (or unlocked) by right-clicking it with a wrench or network tool. When unlocked, it will display any item it's right-clicked with. Shift-right-clicking attempts to insert the item into the network. Shift-double-right-clicking attempts to insert all items of the type displayed into the network. If the monitor is locked, right-clicking attempts to pull out a stack of the item displayed. You cannot insert wrenches or network tools, because shift-right-click will collect the monitor."
