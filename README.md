  - Is your suggestion already possible using Vanilla + AE2?
  - Make sure your feature isn't already in the works, or hasn't been rejected previously.

## Applied Energistics 2 API

The API for Applied Energistics 2. It is open source to discuss changes, improve documentation, and provide better add-on support in general.

Development and standard builds can be obtained [Here](http://ae2.ae-mod.info/Downloads/).

### Maven

When compiling against the AE2 API you can use gradle dependencies, just add

    dependencies {
        compile "appeng:appliedenergistics2:rv_-_____-__:dev"
    }

or add the compile line to your existing dependencies task to your build.gradle

Where the __ are filled in with the correct version criteria; AE2 is available from the default forge maven so no additional repositories are necessary.

An example string would be `appeng:appliedenergistics2:rv2-alpha-30:dev`

## Applied Energistics 2 Localization

### English Text

`en_US` is included in this repository, fixes to typos are welcome.

### Encoding

Files must be encoded as UTF-8.

### New or updated Translations

The language files are located in `/src/main/resources/assets/appliedenergistics2/lang/` and use the [appropriate locale code](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language) as name and `.lang` as extension.

To update an translation edit the corresponding file and improve/correct the existing entry. Or copy any entries from `en_US.lang` for missing translation.

To create a new translation, copy the contents of `en_US.lang`, create a new file with appropriate filename, and translate it to your language.

Please keep in mind that we use [String format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html) to pass additional data to the text for displaying.
Therefore you should preserve parts like `%s` or `%1$d%%`, which allows us to replace them with the correct values while you still have the option to change their order for match the rules of grammar.
This might not be possible for some languages. Should this be the case, please contact us.

### Final Note

If you have have issues localizing something feel free to contact us on IRC, at #AppliedEnergistics on Esper.net

Thanks to everyone helping out to improve localization of AE2.
